Task 2: Treasure Hunt

Build a simple command-line program for helping the user hunt for a treasure that satisfies the following requirements: 1. Build a simple grid with the following layout:
1.
      ########
      #......#
      #.###..#
      #...#.##
      #X#....#
      ########

     # represents an obstacle.
     . represents a clear path.
     X represents the playerâ€™s starting position.

2. A treasure is hidden within one of the clear path points, and the user must find it.
3. From the starting position, the user must navigate in a specific order: 
    a. Up/North A step(s), then
    b. Right/East B step(s), then
    c. Down/South C step(s).
4. The program must output a list of probable coordinate points where the treasure might be located.
5. Bonus points: display the grid with all the probable treasure locations marked with a $ symbol.
